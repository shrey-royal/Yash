## ðŸ“š Resources:

1. Online Booking System:
   - Methods: 'searchAvailableRooms', 'bookRoom'
   - Approach: Use a thread-safe data structure (e.g., synchronized collection) to store room availability. Multiple threads can call 'searchAvailableRooms' to find rooms, and 'bookRoom' to reserve them.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Search for available rooms from multiple threads simultaneously.
     - Attempt to book the same room from multiple threads.

2. Social Media Feed:
   - Methods: 'fetchUserPosts', 'displayFeed'
   - Approach: Each user's posts can be fetched using threads, and then displayed in the user's feed using another thread.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Fetch and display posts from different users concurrently.
     - Test with large number of users and posts.

3. Video Streaming Service:
   - Methods: 'startStreaming', 'bufferVideo'
   - Approach: Use a combination of producer-consumer pattern and thread pooling. Threads fetch video data and buffer it for smooth playback.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Simulate multiple users streaming videos simultaneously.
     - Ensure smooth playback under different network conditions.

4. Online Auction Platform:
   - Methods: 'placeBid', 'extendAuction'
   - Approach: Use synchronization mechanisms to ensure that bids are processed correctly and that auctions are extended if necessary.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Multiple users placing bids concurrently.
     - Test automatic auction extension.

5. Multiplayer Game Server:
   - Methods: 'handlePlayerConnection', 'updateGameLogic'
   - Approach: Use thread pooling to handle incoming player connections. Each thread handles player interaction and game state updates.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Simulate multiple players interacting in the game.
     - Ensure synchronization of game state updates.

6. Financial Trading System:
   - Methods: 'submitOrder', 'processOrder'
   - Approach: Use thread-safe data structures to store orders. Threads process orders and perform risk management checks.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Concurrent order submissions from different users.
     - Test risk management checks.

7. Video Rendering Application:
   - Methods: 'processFrame', 'applyEffect'
   - Approach: Divide the video frames into batches and process them in parallel using threads.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Process video frames with different effects concurrently.
     - Ensure proper synchronization to avoid artifacts.

8. IoT Sensor Data Processing:
   - Methods: 'collectSensorData', 'processData'
   - Approach: Use a thread-safe queue to collect sensor data. Multiple threads process data in parallel.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Simulate data collection from multiple sensors.
     - Test data processing with different types of sensors.

9. Parallel Image Processing:
   - Methods: 'processImage', 'applyFilter'
   - Approach: Divide the images into batches and apply filters to them in parallel using threads.
   - Test Cases: 
     - Process images with different filters concurrently.
     - Test with images of various sizes.

10. Scientific Simulation:
    - Methods: 'simulateExperiment', 'processResult'
    - Approach: Use threads to simulate different parts of the experiment concurrently. Combine results at the end.
    - Test Cases: 
      - Simulate various aspects of the experiment in parallel.
      - Ensure proper synchronization and result aggregation.
