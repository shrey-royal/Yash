1. Hospital Emergency Room Triage:
   Design a system for a hospital's emergency room that uses an 'ArrayBlockingQueue' to manage patients based on their medical condition, ensuring that more critical patients are prioritized for treatment.

2. Music Playlist Management:
   Create a music player application that allows users to create playlists using a 'LinkedList', where they can add, remove, and reorder songs in their playlists efficiently.

3. Airport Baggage Handling:
   Implement a baggage handling system at an airport using an 'ArrayDeque' to ensure that luggage is loaded onto planes in the order it arrives and unloaded in the order it was loaded.

4. Online Chat Application:
   Develop a real-time online chat application that uses a 'LinkedBlockingQueue' to manage incoming messages from multiple users and delivers them to recipients in a fair and timely manner.

5. Restaurant Order Queue:
   Build a restaurant order queue system using an 'ArrayBlockingQueue', where orders from different tables are collected and processed by kitchen staff, ensuring timely delivery of food.

6. Bookstore Inventory Updates:
   Create an inventory management system for a bookstore that uses a 'LinkedList' to keep track of available books, their prices, and quantities, allowing for efficient updates and queries.

7. Data Buffering for IoT Sensors:
   Develop a system to buffer data from IoT sensors using a 'LinkedBlockingQueue' to ensure that sensor readings are stored and processed in real-time without data loss.

8. Social Media Content Queue:
   Design a content scheduling system for a social media platform that uses an 'ArrayDeque' to queue and publish posts at scheduled times while maintaining chronological order.

9. Warehouse Robotics Control:
   Implement a control system for warehouse robots using an 'ArrayBlockingQueue' to manage tasks such as picking, packing, and shipping orders efficiently.

10. Train Reservation System:
    Create a train reservation system where passengers can book tickets and join a waitlist for sold-out trains. Use a 'LinkedBlockingQueue' to manage reservations and waitlisted passengers.

Test Cases:

1. Hospital Emergency Room Triage:

   - Test Case 1 Output: The higher-priority patient is treated first, followed by patients with lower priority.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Patients with the same condition are dequeued in the order they were admitted.
   - Test Case 3 Output: Patients are added and removed, and the priority queue is updated accordingly.

2. Music Playlist Management:

   - Test Case 1 Output: The playlist contains songs in the order they were added.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Songs are removed from the playlist, and it is updated accordingly.
   - Test Case 3 Output: Songs in the playlist are reordered, and the new order is maintained.

3. Airport Baggage Handling:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Luggage items are loaded onto planes in the order they arrived.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Luggage items are unloaded from planes and processed in the order they were loaded.

4. Online Chat Application:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Messages from multiple users are delivered to the intended recipients in the correct order.
   - Test Case 2 Output: The application successfully handles a large number of concurrent messages without data loss.

5. Restaurant Order Queue:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Orders from different tables are added to the kitchen's order queue in the correct sequence.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Completed orders are removed from the queue in the order they were added.

6. Bookstore Inventory Updates:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Books are added to the inventory in the order they were received.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Book quantities and prices are updated, and the inventory reflects the changes.

7. Data Buffering for IoT Sensors:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Sensor readings are successfully buffered in the `LinkedBlockingQueue`.
   - Test Case 2 Output: Buffered data is processed without data loss during high-volume periods.

8. Social Media Content Queue:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Posts are scheduled and published in the correct order.
   - Test Case 2 Output: The system handles time zone differences and daylight saving time adjustments, ensuring accurate scheduling.

9. Warehouse Robotics Control:

   - Test Case 1 Output: Warehouse robot tasks are processed in the correct order.
   - Test Case 2 Output: The system efficiently handles concurrent task requests from multiple robots.

10. Train Reservation System:

    - Test Case 1 Output: Train tickets are booked, passengers are assigned seats, and tickets are confirmed.
    - Test Case 2 Output: Passengers on the waitlist are accommodated if seats become available.
